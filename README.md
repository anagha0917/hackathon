India has one of the world's lowest rate of female participation in the labor force - 65% of Indian women with college degrees are out of work.
Only 23.7 percent of eligible Indian women are part of the workforce,compared to that of 75 percent of men.
The main reason for unemployment of women is that they do not know how to map their interests and skills to available career options.
We have developed a machine learning model that predicts suitable job classes for the candidate based on their input, i.e., their interests.
We use multilayer Perceptron model for the same.
The User Interface is a website which has a questionnaire and a blog of success stories.
The answers are analysed and jobs are predicted.
It is imperative that women are exposed to more job opportunities and hopefully we will see a future where there will be equal participation and contribution from both sides
